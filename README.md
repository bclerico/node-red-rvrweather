# node-red-rvrweather
Node Red flows for Ravenview Ranch weather

The "flows" text file contains 3 Node-Red flows that can be imported into a Node-Red runtime.  Copy the contents of the file to your clipboard and use the Node-Red "import from clipboard" function.

In addition to the standard nodes provided by Node-Red you will need to add 2 additional nodes to the runtime palette:
- slack (get proper name and link)
- openweathermap (get proper name and link)

You will also need to obtain the approprite API keys for Slack and OpenWeatherMap and update the flows accordingly.
